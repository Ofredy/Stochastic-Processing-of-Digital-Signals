Multivariate Gaussian Analysis, PCA, and Histogram Equalization
Overview
This project implements a three-part analysis of statistical and image processing techniques for ECE 6337 (Fall 2024). It includes the following components:

Problem 1: Generating and visualizing multivariate Gaussian data.
Problem 2: Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensions while preserving variance.
Problem 3: Enhancing image contrast using histogram equalization.
Features
Python implementation of multivariate Gaussian sample generation.
Custom PCA function for dimensionality reduction.
Histogram equalization for grayscale image contrast enhancement.
Visual results saved as PNG files.
Getting Started
