# Multivariate Gaussian Analysis, PCA, and Histogram Equalization

## Overview
This project implements a three-part analysis of statistical and image processing techniques for ECE 6337 (Fall 2024). It includes the following components:

## Problem 1: Generating and visualizing multivariate Gaussian data.

## Problem 2: Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensions while preserving variance.

## Problem 3: Enhancing image contrast using histogram equalization.

## Features
Python implementation of multivariate Gaussian sample generation.
Custom PCA function for dimensionality reduction.
Histogram equalization for grayscale image contrast enhancement.

## Results
Generated figures are saved in the figures folder
